# w26-high-risk-intersection

## Direction 1: Causual and Policy-Relevant Analysis
This project extends a predictive analysis of high-risk intersections in Chicago by examining why certain intersections remain dangerous and which interventions meaningfully reduce risk. Using a combination of temporal modeling and infrastructure data, this project group will evaluates how environmental conditions, traffic design, and policy changes interact to shape crash risk across neighborhoods.

## Direction 2: Risk Modeling 
This project models traffic crash risk at the intersection–time level, capturing how danger varies by hour of day, day of week, and season. Using spatial models, the analysis accounts for geographic spillovers between nearby intersections to examine whether high-risk locations cluster temporally as well as spatially. The project aims to identify patterns of risk across the urban street network, providing insights into when and where traffic safety interventions may be most effective.
